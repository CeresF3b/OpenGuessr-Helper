## 📋 Features

- **🔍 “Show Location” Button**  
  Adds a fixed button in the top-right corner that, with a single click, opens Google Maps at your current coordinates.

- **🗺️ Interactive Minimap**  
  - Real-time overlay showing your current position.  
  - Multiple map styles: **Standard**, **Satellite**, **Topographic**.  
  - Built-in zoom and scale controls.  
  - Minimize/restore functionality keeps a compact icon when not in use.

- **⏱️ Automatic Updates**  
  - Position refreshed every 2 seconds.  
  - Pauses updates when the browser tab is not visible to save resources.

- **🔄 Reliable Initialization**  
  - Continuously checks the DOM for the panorama iframe or Leaflet container.  
  - Fallback initialization after 5 seconds if needed.  
  - MutationObserver recreates button and minimap on page or mode changes.

- **🌐 Reverse Geocoding**  
  - Fetches and displays the place name via OpenStreetMap/Nominatim beneath the minimap.
